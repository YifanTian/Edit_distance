Compile command: make (use ‘make clean’ to remove previous make)
Run command: ./edit

Which will automatically run edit function on 
1. sample.txt
2. Question1:  “x = electrical engineering, y = computer science” two strings
3. Question2:	input1.txt, input2.txt, input3.txt
At line 217, in main function, you can change input file.

The result will be printed in terminal.

For question 3. We use the std::list library to implement the linked list data structure to do the edit operations. In the edit.cpp, at line 39 we implement the linked list.
